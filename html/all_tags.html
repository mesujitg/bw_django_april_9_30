		Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not 
		simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
		classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it 
		over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin 
		professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
		looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
		consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and 
		going through the cites of the word in classical 
		literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
		<br />
		Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 
		1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
		(The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, 
		written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on 
		the theory of ethics, very popular during the 
		Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 
		"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a 
		line in section 1.10.32.
		<hr />
		The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since 
		the 1500s is reproduced below for those 
		interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 
		from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero 
		are also reproduced in their exact original form, 
		accompanied by English versions from the 1914 
		translation by H. Rackham.
